# ComplexMatricies
Java classes for working with complex numbers and complex valued matrices (including real matrices).

This collection of java code was written in 2012 and 2013 for my Capstone project in the honors mathematics program at
Southern Oregon University. It's being posted to github as part of my online resume. 

The primary purpose of this collection
was to demonstrate my understanding and mastery of the QR algorithm: a numerical method for solving the eigen problem for 
most matrices. Once I had completed that, I began to explore the singular value decomposition (SVD) but didn't get much
farther than successfully implementing it; idealy I would have explored some applications, like image compression or cluster analysis.
